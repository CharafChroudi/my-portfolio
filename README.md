# my-portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio!

I created my MVP portfolio using the structure we have learned with the react modules so an index.js that creats the root that gets serve up to the webpage.

The component called App is my main component where I end up import all other 5 components into it and rendering them from there.

I made a navbar that will follow you along the whole length of the page so that makes it easier to navigate through different areas of the website.

I opted for the styled components for my css since it is something still new and I thought it won't be as cluttered since my styling is somewhat simple (I still haven't explored cool css techniques and more responsivness)

I tried thinking of a way to use both UseState and UseEffect but I ended up using UseRef instead for my scrolling feature.

In the future things I want to work on and improve :

-MUCH better css (perhaps using a library) and full responsivness of the website.
-Detailing and desplaying my work and what I can do in more unique way.
-A more user-friendly contact me section and that it actually functions as intended (sending the email correctly)
